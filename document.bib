@article{Horridge2006,
abstract = {This paper describes a new syntax that can be used to write OWL ontologies, and fragments of OWL ontologies for presentation and editing purposes. The syntax, which is known as the Manchester OWL Syntax, was developed in response to a demand from a wide range of users, who do not have a Description Logic background, for aless logician like syntax. The Manchester OWL Syntax is derived from the OWL Abstract Syntax, but is less verbose and minimises the use of brackets. This means that it is quick and easy to read and write. The important features of the syntax are discussed, and a reference implementation of a Java based parser is described.},

@article{Ashburner2000,
abstract = {Genomic sequencing has made it clear that a large fraction of the genes specifying the core biological functions are shared by all eukaryotes. Knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. The goal of the Gene Ontology Consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. To this end, three independent ontologies accessible on the World-Wide Web are being constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.},
